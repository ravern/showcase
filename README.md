# Showcase

Synced exhibition boards for public showcase.

Showcase presents a method of distributing a set of posters/exhibition boards across a set of screens and continuously rotating them. The boards are distributed evenly across the screens and synced in real-time. The interval and number of screens can be adjusted and updated.
